# draft-for-assign02
  The project will be generally divied to two parts, one is the S file and the other one is c file part
  S file will handle the time count problem as well as how to interract with the user (deal with the button pressed and button drepressed)
  C file need to decide the levels adn handle with the users' input, compare the users' input with the pattern morse code, generate the random morse code 
for users,define the morse code for different characters and different words. 
  And this is a basic idea of how we should coopreate between group members,and below is group members' responsiblity:
  
  Weijian Zou: responsible for  coding for S file and help with issues how to connect c file with the s file .
  
  Dmitry Kryukov:do most part of the c file, handle with comparing the mosrse string with the users' input.Also the output of the the project for users 
to show the outcome of the users' input.
  
  Kostiantyn Ohorodnyk:coding for the head file of the c file which will define the word and its morse code, and help with Dmitry Kryukov to finish 
the c file, initialize the led and choose a suitable led color for different outcome.
